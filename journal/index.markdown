--- [The Art, Science and Engineering of
Programming](http://programming-journal.org/) is a new journal that
publishes research papers about programming, including, as the name
says, papers that document the art of programming from a scholarly
perspective.

Papers submitted to the journal are reviewed by referees chosen by the
‹Programming› Conference Program Chair, who is an editor for the
journal. Authors of accepted papers are invited to present at the
conference as a requirement for publication. Authors needing financial
assistance for attending the conference should contact the Program
Chair of the conference.
