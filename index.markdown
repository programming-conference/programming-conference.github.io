The _International Conference on the Art, Science, and Engineering of
Programming_ is a new conference focused on everything to do with
programming including the experience of programming. We’ve named it
**‹Programming›** for short.

The conference features presentations from authors of research papers,
as well as invited talks covering interesting work in the field.

### Journal Affiliated

A [new, open access journal](http://programming-journal.org) is in the
works as the publication vehicle for ‹Programming›. Papers submitted
to this journal are reviewed by referees chosen by the ‹Programming›
Program Chair, who is an editor for the journal. Authors of accepted
papers submitted to the Programming Conference editor are invited to
present at the conference as a requirement for publication. Authors
needing financial assistance for attending the conference should
contact the Program Chair.
